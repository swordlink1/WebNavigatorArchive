# Welcome to the WebNavigator Archive
In this archive, I store all versions of WebNavigator. (excluding beta builds of versions) I'll try to remember to upload a new version everytime I make a version, enjoy! Note that I made web browser for "fun" a long time ago and is just a novelty. This is not a good web browser either, using IE's engine with VB.NET and WinForms.
# Why are some versions not in the releases tab?
Those are old versions without setups. I wouldn't want to pack the old versions in a zip or create installer files. However, you can still download the branch and extract the folder you want!
# Important Note
This was made 3 months ago and WebNavigator is now obsolete. You should try VisualBrowser.NET. I lost 1.17 beta when I was cleaning up my computer.
# License
You can modify, distribute, and use this software in any way.
