# Welcome to the WebNavigator Archive
In this archive, I store all versions of WebNavigator. (excluding beta builds of versions) I'll try to remember to upload a new version everytime I make a version, enjoy!
# Why are some versions not in the releases tab?
Those are old versions without setups. I wouldn't want to pack the old versions in a zip or create installer files. However, you can still download the branch and extract the folder you want!
